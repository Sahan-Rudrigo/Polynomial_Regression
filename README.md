ðŸ“ˆ Polynomial Regression Experiments
This repository contains multiple implementations and experiments using Polynomial Regression to model non-linear relationships between variables. The primary goal is to explore how different polynomial degrees affect model performance and prediction accuracy.

âœ… What's Included
ðŸ“Š Simple Linear Regression (as a baseline)

ðŸ”¢ Polynomial Regression models with varying degrees (e.g., 2, 3, 4, up to 10)

ðŸ§® RÂ² Score evaluation for all models

ðŸŽ¯ Hyperparameter tuning (degree selection)

ðŸ“‰ Visualizations of model fits and comparisons
